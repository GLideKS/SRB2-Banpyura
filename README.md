SRB2 Banpyura is a custom netgame compatible build of Sonic Robo Blast 2. It has a plethora of fixes, improvements, and new features fully based on contributions and other changes the community made, but still holding modding accuracy with SRB2 Vanilla.

> [!CAUTION]
> I (GLide KS) do not assume any responsibility for add-ons loaded locally (feature introduced in SRB2 Kart Saturn, ported to SRB2-Banpyura). If you choose to load or use add-ons for malicious or harmful purposes, you're completely on your own responsibility.

Icon credits goes to ClovesCloestarSRB2 and his addon [New Springs](https://mb.srb2.org/addons/new-springs.8942/) from the base spring.

- `r_secbright` Configurable minimum sector brightness (SRB2-Legacy)
- Readded 2.1 sprite shadows! Enabled using `shadow Sprite` in OpenGL. (SRB2-Legacy)

### Gameplay / Netplay

- `addfilelocal` allows you to load addons locally. Can be accessed via Addons Menu and pressing Right Alt as well. (SRB2 Kart Saturn)
- Fixed SRB2's loading time. (SRB2-Classic)
- Minimum input delay and Gentleman's delay (Ring Racers)
- Lifted netxcmd limits (SRB2-Classic)
- `cam_centertoggle` and `cam2_centertoggle` are not exclusive to the Automatic playstyle.
- Rejoin server menu with timestamps (Ring Racers)
- Added total progress bar while downloading addons from a server.

### Lua

- Added `CameraThinker` hook to alter the camera's behavior.
- - `player` and `camera` are passed in as arguments. Return `true` to override vanilla camera movement.
- Added HTTP library from SRB2 AX.
- - Check the wiki (https://github.com/GLideKS/SRB2-Banpyura/wiki/Lua-stuff) for more details.

### Miscellaneous

- Improved GIF/movie recording. (Movie HUD, default size limit of 20 MB, fixed aPNG, etc.)
- The game now goes to the title or drops a warning instead of crashing on the following situations: `Invalid sector number from server`, `Invalid line number from server`, `Savegame corrupted`, `polyobj count inconsistency`, SOCK_Send errors.
- `saveaddons` saves the current addon order to be loaded as a console script. Useful for quickly testing addon lists locally for servers.
- Don't reset chasecam and do not run special stage wipe on resync (Jisk, Lugent)
- Fixed chats not being saved on the logs in Linux systems
- Removed 5-second delay upon disconnecting from servers
- Fixed nameless servers causing other servers to not display.
- The `help` command is now sorted by origin (Vanilla, Banpyura, Addon). You can use `-v`, `-c`, and `-a` respectively to only print out only those sections. (You can use more than one flag at once).
- Doing merely `<cvar>` has the same effect as `help <cvar>`.
- Console variable information is more in-depth.
- - You can choose to hide certain sections via `cvarinfo` ("Show All" by default).
- See the amount of used freeslots using `freeslots`.
- Force console input with the `-forceconsole` parameter.

**Most of these options can be found in the menu under Banpyura Options....**
